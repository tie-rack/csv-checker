"all","good","row"
"good","bad "example" value","row"
"this","one","forgets to end
"and","this","is okay"

I assert that "this" is,a,good line
"this,should be handled",just,fine
"but, here's "one,more,bad line
"and this ""has a, comma",after,a quoted quote which is okay
after empty fields,you can have,,,"a quoted one with a, comma",and it's fine
"if you have two lines with open fields
"in a row, both are reported
